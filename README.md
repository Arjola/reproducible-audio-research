### Melody Extraction from Polyphonic Music Signals: Approaches, Applications and Challenges
Justin Salamon et. al.

We present a novel system for the automatic extraction of the main melody from polyphonic music recordings. Our approach is based on the creation and characterisation of pitch contours, time continuous sequences of pitch candidates grouped using auditory streaming cues. We define a set of contour characteristics and show that by studying their distributions we can devise rules to distinguish between melodic and non-melodic contours. This leads to the development of new voicing detection, octave error minimisation and melody selection techniques. A comparative evaluation of the proposed approach shows that it outperforms current state-of-the-art melody extraction systems in terms of overall accuracy. Further evaluation of the algorithm is provided in the form of a qualitative error analysis and the study of the effect of key parameters and algorithmic components on system performance. Finally, we conduct a glass ceiling analysis to study the current limitations of the method, and possible directions for future work are proposed.

### Singing-Voice Separation From Monaural Recordings Using Robust Principal Component Analysis
Po-Sen Huang, Scott Deeann Chen, Paris Smaragdis, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson

Separating singing voices from music accompaniment is an important task in many applications, such as music information retrieval, lyric recognition and alignment. Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1âˆ¼1.4 dB higher GNSDR compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features.
